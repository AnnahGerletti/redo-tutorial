### Getting Started

There are two steps for getting started. 
- you need to clone down the repo
- install and start server

```
> git clone https://github.com/AnnahGerletti/redo-tutorial.git
> cd redo-tutorial
> npm install
> npm start - there is a server and want to use localhost:8080
```

# codecept Testing framework added to tutorial
#### Documentation is good - can be confussing  

https://codecept.io/

# Key things to rememeber

1. KEY: Don't get *codecept.io* mixed up with *codeception* DIFFERENT. 
- codeceptjs = codecept.io

2. Helpful github repo
- https://github.com/Codeception/CodeceptJS

3. To Run your tests 
- run codecept --steps
** the comd can be changed in your scripts part of the package.jason**

4. Quick Start is a good reference starting point
- https://codecept.io/quickstart/
 
 #### Example Test code
 ```sh
 Scenario('Can user see page title', function * (I) {
  I.amOnPage(globals.pageUrl)
  let title = yield I.grabTitle()
  // I.seeInTitle("Video Player") wrong title
  assert.equal(title, 'React Redux')
})
```
- The 'I' key word is part of the Acceptance testing framewrok, every test starts with it. 
- Must consider all Edge cases. 
- `I.amOnPage` is one of the Codecept.io helpers
- `yield` is an ES6 genorator function, can read about these here:
